# Xanthomonas_blastdb
A database of Xanthomonas genomes for local blast searching

This database contains genomes of Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri of three different pathotypes (A, A* and Aw) for performing local BLAST searches to obtain preliminary identification of pathotype.

Included are two scripts for updating the blast database with new genome sequences as well as performing a local blastn search.
